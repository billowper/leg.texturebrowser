# Texture Browser
Editor window that shows textures, similar to old school map editors like Valve's Hammer Editor.

- drag & drop into scene view
- auto-magic Material generation if none-exists already
- search and display size \o/
- works with RealtimeCSG, which is the main reason I made this
- more soon stuff maybe?
