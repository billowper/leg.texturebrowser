Editor window that shows textures, similar to old school map editors like Valve's Hammer Editor.

- drag & drop into scene view
- auto-magic Material generation if none-exists already
- search, favourites and filter by scene-usage
- adjustable preview size
- preferences UI for default folders + shader to use when generating new materials
- works with RealtimeCSG, which is the main reason I made this
- more soon stuff maybe?
