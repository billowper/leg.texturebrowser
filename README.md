# Texture Browser
![Unity_2025-04-16_01-08-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d06bd9f-c9e3-4f70-8e26-20ebd1bee6a6)

Editor window that shows textures, similar to old school map editors like Valve's Hammer Editor.

- drag & drop into scene view
- auto-magic Material generation if none-exists already
- search, favourites and filter by scene-usage
- adjustable preview size
- preferences UI for default folders + shader to use when generating new materials
- works with RealtimeCSG, which is the main reason I made this
- more soon stuff maybe?

Textures pictured in the screenshot are from the wonderful [Torment pack by Strideh](https://strideh.itch.io/torment) 

## Installation & Usage
- download package and unzip to `/Packages` folder, or just copy paste the contents of `/Editor` into your project.
- open via menu `Low End Games/Texture Browser`
- I'll add proper package installation soon!?

## Preferences
- configure folders used for texture and material scanning
- select a default shader & main texture keyword for generating materials
